Golang Learning Notes

- go env GOPATH  
- cd = Change directory 
- mkdir = Make new directory  

- The first line in a Golang program must be the name of the package. 	
- Every package needs to have the package name “main” 

Variables: 
- When variables are given an initial value, the short hand syntax is as follows: 
    - Remove the “val” and replace the “int” or whatever data type it is and use “:=“ instead

- An array holds multiple elements of the same type but the number of elements it holds is fixed. It has a specific length. 
- Arrays are 0 index so the first element starts at “0”. 
- Slices are an abstraction of top of arrays to make them easier to work with. Slices don’t have a fixed number of elements. 
- So for instance, if you wanted to create a slice of integers instead of an array of integers, simply remove the element count and leave empty square brackets []

- The append functions can add more values to add something new to the end of a slice. Append does not modify the original slice, it returns a new one. 

- Maps are key-value pairs and are similar to dictionaries in Python.
    - To make a map use, variablename := make(map[data type 1]datatype2)
- The “delete” function can be used to delete something from a map

On Mac: 
- go run “filename.go” to execute and run a go file in a terminal.
